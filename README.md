# a drawing app, made in bevy...
This is my personal project to learn bev and rust, the goal of this
project is to mimic mspaint while maintaining crossplatform support.
I personally found mspaint's palette and simplicity amazing, so
the color palette and simplicity are goals here as well. :3

## Building
1. download code
2. cd into the crate
3. run `cargo build --release`
4. enjoy your `bevy-draw.exe` found inside of `build/release`

## TODO
- [ ] pen smoothing
- [ ] eraser

- [ ] pen pressure
- [ ] <!-- I fuckin hate PDFs -->PDF support
- [ ] garlic bread
- [ ] dragon-inator
- [ ] plushsuit
